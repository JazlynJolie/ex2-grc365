    <h1>A Message to My Leo Friends</h1>
    <h3>@ricotaquito</h3>
    
    <p>
      If <em>you're</em> my friend, and you're a <b>leo</b>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>I forgive you.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I forgive you for <em>who</em> you are and <em>how</em> you act in the way you tend to be.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And I think that's enough. <strong>I forgive you</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Like <em>literally</em>, it's not your fault you're a <b>leo</b>, but you act like that. <br>So, I <em>have</em> to forgive you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And that's <i>my</i> gift to you this season. <br><strong>Love you!</strong>
